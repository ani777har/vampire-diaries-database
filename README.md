# The Vampire Diaries Database Project

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database for "The Vampire Diaries" TV series. The database maps characters, episodes, relationships, and other relevant details, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.

## Files & Structure
- **TVD Database Creation.sql** → SQL script for creating database tables and setting up relationships.
- **TVD Data Insertion.sql** → SQL script for inserting data into the database.
- **TVD Queries.sql** → A collection of SQL queries to retrieve insights from the database.
- **Functions + Triggers.sql** → SQL functions and triggers used for data validation and automation.
- **TVD ERD.png** → Entity-Relationship Diagram representing the database structure.
- **TVD Relational Schema.pdf** → Documentation explaining table relationships and attributes.
- **TVD_Normalization.xlsx** → Spreadsheet detailing normalization processes.
- **Group Project Proposal.docx** → Initial proposal outlining the project objectives and scope.

## How to Use
1. **Download or clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. Use a **SQL database management system** (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) to run the scripts.
3. **Execute `TVD Database Creation.sql`** to create the necessary tables.
4. **Run `TVD Data Insertion.sql`** to populate the tables with data.
5. **Use `TVD Queries.sql`** to explore different insights from the database.
6. **Refer to `TVD ERD.png` and `TVD Relational Schema.pdf`** for database structure understanding.
7. **Check `Functions + Triggers.sql`** for additional automation and logic.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have a working SQL environment with support for:
- Standard SQL syntax
- Foreign key constraints
- Functions and triggers

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured database for analyzing "The Vampire Diaries" TV series, allowing efficient data retrieval on characters, episodes, and relationships.
